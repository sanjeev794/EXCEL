1. sub abc()
   dim num as integer
   num =CInt(inputbox("please enter any integer"))
   if num Mod 2<> 1 then
   MsgBox str(num) +"is a Even Number"
   else
   MsgBox str(num) +"is a odd number"
   End if
   End sub

3.In Visual Basic, errors fall into one of three categories: 
  syntax errors, run-time errors, and logic errors.

4. Use the Resume Next statement with On Error. 

5. (i)  Use 'On Error Go [Label]' at the beginning of the code.
   (ii) Use 'On Error Resume Next' ONLY when you're sure about the errors that can occur.
   (iii) When using error handlers, make sure you're using Exit Sub before the handlers.
   (iv) Use multiple error handlers to trap different kinds of errors.

6.  With VBA, you can create a custom Function (also called a User Defined Function) that can be used in the worksheets just like regular functions.
    These are helpful when the existing Excel functions are not enough.
           Function Mul() As Double
           Dim C As Integer
           C = ActiveCell.Column
           Mul = Cells(11, C) * Cells(115, C)
           End Function
