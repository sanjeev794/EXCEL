1.  Three different flavors in VBA: Standard, Object, and Class modules.
          VBA helps to make frequent everyday tasks less repetitive via macros.
          Macros can automate just about any task—like generating customized charts and reports, 
          and performing word- and data-processing functions.

2.Class module:  This module is used to create objects at run time. 
                Class module are used by Advanced VBA programmers and will be covered at a later stage.
  
Module:  A VBA module is used to store any VBA code that you have written in the VBE (Visual Basic Editor).
              The modules are contained within a VBA Project and when the file is saved – 
              be it an Excel workbook, Word document or Access database, the module or modules are saved within that file
              that file is essentially the parent application of the module
 
3.  A procedure tells the application how to perform a specific task.
    Use procedures to divide complex code tasks into more manageable units. 
    To create a procedure by writing code. Open the module for which you want to write the procedure.
               
            Property procedure:
                            A property procedure is a series of Visual Basic statements that allow 
                            a programmer to create and manipulate custom properties. 
            Function procedure:
                           A Function procedure is a series of Visual Basic statements enclosed
                           by the Function and End Function statements

    To create a procedure by writing code. Open the module for which you want to write the procedure.
               
            Property procedure:

            Function procedure:
                           A Function procedure is a series of Visual Basic statements enclosed
                           by the Function and End Function statements

5.   A Sub procedure is a series of Visual Basic statements enclosed by the Sub and End Sub statements.
     The Sub procedure performs a task and then returns control to the calling code,
     but it does not return a value to the calling code.
            
            A sub procedure can take two forms, i.e., private and public.
                   The private sub procedure can only be used in the current module.

6.  Step 1: Select the Statements from code.
    Step 2: Click on View -> Toolbars -> Customize.
    Step 3: From Customize Window Click on Commands -> Edit, then select Comment Block.
               select all the lines and then use the comment button from the toolbar or you can also add an apostrophe
               at the starting of each line. The moment you click the comment button 
                it will convert all the lines into a multi-line comment block
